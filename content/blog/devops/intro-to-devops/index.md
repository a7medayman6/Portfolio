# DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS (DEVOPS)


## What is DevOps ?

- DevOps is the practice of operations and development engineers participating together in the entire software development life cycle.

- The DevOps is a combination of two words, one is software Development,  and second is Operations. This allows a single team to handle the entire application life-cycle, from development to **testing, deployment**, and **operations**. 
- DevOps helps you to reduce the disconnection between software developers, quality assurance (QA) engineers, and system administrators.

- DevOps promotes collaboration between Development and Operations team to deploy code to production faster in an automated & repeatable way. 

- DevOps automates a huge part of the software development life cycle which leads to:

  1. less human errors.

  2. quick feedback, which leads to quick bug fixing.

  3. building and testing of each phase in parallel to the development.

## Why DevOps ?

### Without DevOps :

- After the design-build, the testing and deployment are performed respectively. That's why they consumed more time than actual build cycles. 
- The team members are spending a large amount of time on designing, testing, and deploying instead of building the project.
- Manual code deployment leads to human errors in production. 
- Development and operation teams have their separate time-lines and are not in sync, causing further delays.

So that why we need DevOps, to solve these problems and stop making delivery delays because of simple problems.

## DevOps Architecture Features

### 1. Automation

- Automation can reduce time consumption, especially during the testing and deployment phase.
- Automation will lead in catching bugs quickly so that it can be fixed easily.
- For continuous delivery, each code is defined through automated tests, cloud-based services, and builds. 

### 2. Collaboration

- The Development and Operations team collaborates as a DevOps team.
- The teams share their responsibilities and work closely in sync, which in turn makes the deployment to production faster.

### 3. Integration

-  The integration phase is merging the existing code is combined with new functionality and then tested.
-  Continuous integration and testing enable continuous development.
- continuous integration and delivery are implemented to deliver in a **quicker, safer**, and **reliable manner**.

### 4. Configuration management

- It ensures the application to interact with only those resources that are concerned with the environment in which it runs.
- The configuration file can be written during deployment, or they can be  loaded at the run time, depending on the environment in which it is  running.
